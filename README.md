# Base Utils Toolkit

Small helper contracts and notes for working with the **Base** network.

- **Author:** [Alexpro780](https://github.com/Alexpro780)
- **Networks:** Base Mainnet (8453), Base Sepolia (84532)
- **Purpose:** Provide simple, reusable building blocks and constants for other Base projects.

## What is inside?

### `contracts/BaseNetworkConfig.sol`

A small contract that exposes common chain IDs and placeholder RPC URLs for Base networks.

### `contracts/BaseAddressBook.sol`

A tiny helper that stores important addresses (for example USDC, routers, dApps) for Base Mainnet.
You can adjust the addresses later if something changes
